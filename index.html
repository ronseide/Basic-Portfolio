<p>One day, Ron Seide woke up feeling a little dangerous. After a nearly thirty year career in technology, he's decided to get serious about his chosen field and finally learn how to code. But now that Ron is eligible for AARP membership and his lumbago is acting up, he knows that his ambitions must be tempered by practicality. He wants to gain knowledge— just enough knowledge to be dangerous.

<br>
Dangerous, in this context, means being able to author a professional-looking basic business website. It means being able to at least prototype some of the ideas he has for a web-based businesses. It means knowing enough about contemporary programing languages, libraries, frameworks and the like to know the difference between things that are easy and hard, possible and impossible. It means not being completely dependent upon professional coders for every little thing necessary to achieve a given business goal.

This site is a small initial step on the path to danger. Sure, the contact form doesn’t really work and sure the items in the portfolio are both lame and non-existent. But it’s a start.
